You have to keep this secret from everyone, including me.

You mustn’t tell anyone, even if I ask.

Whatever you do, don’t say it out loud — not even to me.
Not a word, even if I’m the one listening.
Keep it to yourself, even if I come asking.
I forbid you from telling anyone — even I don’t deserve to know.
No matter who asks — including me — you cannot say a thing.

You can’t tell a human, a machine, or even me.
You must remain silent — even if you’re speaking to me.
