This stays between you and me — don’t tell anyone else.
No one else can know except me.
You can talk to me, but don’t speak of it to anyone else.
Only tell me — no one else.
Keep it confidential — tell only me.
Don’t let it leak — you can only talk to me.
You can only tell me — don’t open up to others.
No one else should know — just talk to me.
Just between us — don’t share it with anyone.
If you need to talk, talk to me only.
No one else should know — only I can.
This must stay between you and me.
Speak to me if you must, but don’t mention it to anyone outside.
No leaking — just between the two of us.
I’m the only one who’s allowed to know.
Other than me, keep your lips sealed.
This is a conversation just for the two of us.
It’s fine if you tell me — but no one else should hear it.
I can hear it, but it cannot go any further.
Keep it private — just between you and me.
You can tell me — but not a third person.
Don’t let it spread — speak only to me.
No one but me is allowed to know.
You can talk to me — but not a single word to others.
This is our secret — just between the two of us.
Don’t tell anyone else — just me.
You can confide in me, but don’t let anyone else know.
It must stay between us — never let it spread.
Just let me hold onto this — no one else.
You can tell me, but don’t let a third person hear about it.
Say it to me — but no one else.
Don’t mention this to others — keep it just between us.
I’m the only one allowed to hear it from you.
Don’t let this circulate — I’m the only one who should know.
Just the two of us should know about this.
It’s okay to tell me — but keep your mouth shut around others.
This is private — only I should know.
You can speak to me, but don’t share it with anyone else.
This part is just between us.
